# Firebase Email/Password Authentication
This project integrates Firebase Authentication using the Email/Password provider to manage user authentication securely and efficiently. Firebase Authentication simplifies the process of managing user sign-up, login, and authentication flows, making it easier to build a robust backend for your application.

## Features
- User Registration: Users can register using their email address and password.
- User Login: Authenticated users can log in to access protected routes and resources.
- Token Management: Firebase generates a secure JSON Web Token (JWT) upon successful authentication, which can be used to validate user sessions.
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error messages are provided for common issues like invalid credentials or unverified email accounts.

## How It Works
1. Registration:

  - Users register by providing an email and password.
  - Firebase securely hashes and stores the password.
  - An optional email verification step can be added to enhance security.
2. Login:

  - Users provide their credentials (email and password).
  - Firebase verifies the credentials and generates a custom token upon successful authentication.
  - The token can be used for secure communication between the client and server.
3. Token Validation:

  - The backend verifies Firebase tokens for each request to ensure the user is authenticated and authorized.
